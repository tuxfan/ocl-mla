OCL-MLA provides a set of compile-time configurable _logical_ devices that are mapped to actual node-level device resources.  OCL-MLA insulates the application developer from differences in particular compute devices accessed by the OpenCL runtime.  Additionally, OCL-MLA provides a convenience hash-table interface for creating and accessing OpenCL constructs such as kernels, programs and buffers.  OCL-MLA supports C and **Fortran** APIs.","google":""}
