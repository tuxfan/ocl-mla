Machine files are used to conveniently specify a set of configuration
parameters by setting autoconf variables.

The 'templates' sub-directory covers most permutations that are possible.
These provide a good starting point for tailoring ocl-mla to your system.

# File naming conventions
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------#

The first letter of the machine file indicates the host OS:

L = linux
O = OS X

The second letter of the machine file indicates the preferred OpenCL device
type for the logical performance device.

A = 'CL_DEVICE_TYPE_ACCELERATOR'
C = 'CL_DEVICE_TYPE_CPU'
G = 'CL_DEVICE_TYPE_GPU'

The third letter of the machine file indicates the OpenCL platform used
for the logical performance device:

A = "AMD Accelerated Parallel Processing"
D = "default"
I = "Intel(R) OpenCL"
O = "Apple"
N = "NVIDIA CUDA"

The fourth letter of the machine file indicates the preferred OpenCL device
type for the logical auxiliary device.

A = 'CL_DEVICE_TYPE_ACCELERATOR'
C = 'CL_DEVICE_TYPE_CPU'
G = 'CL_DEVICE_TYPE_GPU'

The fifth letter of the machine file indicates the OpenCL platform used
for the logical auxiliary device:

A = "AMD Accelerated Parallel Processing"
D = "default"
I = "Intel(R) OpenCL"
O = "Apple"
N = "NVIDIA CUDA"

The sixth letter of the machine file indicates the C compiler:

G = gcc
I = icc
P = pgcc

NOTE: These specifications only apply to the CFLAGS settings in the
file.  Actual compiler selection should be set from the command line when
the 'configure' script is run, e.g.:
% CC=gcc ../configure --prefix=...

The seventh letter of the machine file indicates the Fortran compiler:

G = gfortran
I = ifort
P = pgf95

NOTE: These specifications only apply to the FCFLAGS settings in the
file.  Actual compiler selection should be set from the command line when
the 'configure' script is run, e.g.:
% FC=ifort ../configure --prefix=...
