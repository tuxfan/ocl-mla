						DIRECT VESION 1.2

		A "fast" O(N^2) gravity code useful for checking more
		sophisticated gravity codes, such as tree-codes,
		Fast Multipole codes  and FFT-based grid codes. Also useful
		in the analysis of errors and approximations in such codes.

				Stadel Release 1.2: October 11, 1994 

		Featrures:
			* Checkpointing
			* Mark Arrays
			* Periodic Boundary Conditions using the
			  Ewald Summation Technique
			* Several gravitational softening methods:
				Plummer, Uniform density sphere and Cubic Spline

		Changes from v1.11:
			* Masses are now always taken from the TIPSY BINARY input
			  file. You can no longer specify -m or -dm.
			* Softening is taken from the TIPSY BINARY input file, by
			  default. If you want to set the softening (say to zero)
			  then you can specify the -e argument as before.
			* Softening is done in a symmetric fashion, that is, the 
		      interaction between patricle i and particle j uses the
			  softening fSoft = 0.5*(fSoft_i + fSoft_j). If all the
			  particles have the same softening this is equivalent to
			  the previous definition.
